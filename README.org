* Screen-settings
Since there is currently a bug with AMD radeon multi gpu systems with the AMD open driver, over time I had to create a script that would take care of solving the heinous riulo that the aforementioned
module could not perform correctly, especially under X11, it wasn't very simple, because I hadn't found documentation about it, but in the end I managed to find a square.
** What will the repository contain?
The repository will contain my script plus all the documentation to correctly generate your own file to be executed at X11 startup to maintain your setup without having to reset it every damn time,
then the actual documentation.
** My setup
My setup includes a 22" monitor in 16:9 resolution 1920x1080 horizontally named in the graph (/screen1/), a 19" monitor resolution *1360x768* (/screen3/) and a 22" monitor in 16:9 resolution 1920x1080 vertically named (/screen2/)
